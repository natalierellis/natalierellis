# 👋 Hi, I'm Natalie Ellis!  

### 🎓 About Me  
- Master's student in Health Informatics and Data Science at Georgetown University.  
- Passionate about advancing healthcare through data-driven insights and bioinformatics techniques.  

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools  
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python, SQL, R (including DESeq2, ggplot2)  
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib, ggplot2  
- **Bioinformatics:** BLAST, Seaview, Comparative Genomics, EnrichR, clusterProfiler  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Platforms & Tools:** TCGA, G-DOC Hub, Seven Bridges, Xena Browser, CIBERSORT, CRAVAT, IGV, All of Us  

### 🌟 Current Interests  
- **Developing Risk Prediction Models:**  
  - Train predictive models using genetic and environmental features to assess cancer risk across cohorts (no cancer, precancerous, cancer).  
  - Generate calibrated risk scores and use SHAP or similar techniques to decompose contributions into genetic and environmental factors.  
  - Validate and refine models to ensure actionable insights for targeted screening and interventions.  
- **Advancing Healthcare Analytics:**  
  - Leverage bioinformatics tools to integrate multi-omics data for precision medicine.  
  - Use machine learning to uncover novel biomarkers and improve risk stratification.
