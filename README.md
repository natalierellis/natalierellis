### 🎓 About Me  
- Master's student in Health Informatics and Data Science at Georgetown University.  
- Passionate about leveraging data-driven solutions to advance precision medicine initiatives and solve complex healthcare challenges.  
- Currently seeking **Data Analyst** or **Data Scientist** roles in the DMV area starting Fall 2025.  

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools  
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python, SQL, R  
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib, ggplot2  
- **Bioinformatics:** BLAST, Seaview, EnrichR, CIBERSORT  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Platforms & Tools:** TCGA, G-DOC Hub, Seven Bridges, Xena Browser, CRAVAT, IGV, All of Us  

### 🌟 Current Interests  
- **Developing Risk Prediction Models:**  
  - Training predictive models using genetic and environmental features to assess cancer risk across cohorts (no cancer, precancerous, cancer).  
- **Advancing Healthcare Analytics:**  
  - Leveraging bioinformatics tools to integrate multi-omics data for precision medicine.  
  - Using machine learning to uncover novel biomarkers and improve risk stratification.  

### 🌱 Projects  
- **Patient Mortality Prediction:** Designed and implemented a machine learning pipeline to predict 180-day patient mortality using synthetic EHR data.  
- **Comparative Cancer Genomics:** Performed comparative analyses in R on cancer datasets to identify genomic features associated with disease relapse.  
- **Hypertension Referral Workflow:** Developed Tableau dashboards and OpenEMR interventions to streamline referral workflows and reduce unnecessary hypertension clinic referrals.  
- **COVID Patient Registry Integration:** Wrote SQL queries to integrate EMR data for a multi-stakeholder COVID patient registry proposal.  
- **RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline:** Built a pipeline for differential gene expression analysis, leveraging edgeR and limma packages to analyze genomic datasets.  

### 🌟 Notable Experience  
- **Postbac Fellow at NIH:**  
  - Harmonized clinical and genomic data to assess the relationship between alcohol-related phenotypes and epigenetic aging.  
  - Built regression models and visualizations to study effects of alcoholism on biological aging.  
  - Coordinated patient recruitment and screenings for clinical trials, contributing to a PCSK9 inhibition study.  

- **Wake Forest University:**  
  - Developed RNA-Seq pipelines and genome annotation workflows.  
  - Graduated **Summa Cum Laude** with a major in Biology and a focus on bioinformatics.
