## About Me  
I specialize in **clinical data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing** to drive **precision medicine innovations**. Currently, I am developing a survival model for cancer risk prediction using genomic, clinical, and lifestyle data from All of Us.  

I am seeking Clinical Data Analyst or Bioinformatics Analyst roles starting Summer 2025.

### Skills & Tools  
- **Programming & Data Science**: Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Statsmodels, Pandas
- **Bioinformatics**: Hail, RNA-Seq, srWGS, Variant Filtering, BLAST, KEGG, enrichR
- **Biostatistics & Health Informatics**: OMOP-CDM, Survival Analysis, HAPI FHIR API, Kaplan-Meier curves
- **Cloud & Big Data**: All of Us Workbench, Google Cloud (GCP), BigQuery, HPC/Linux, Feature Engineering
- **Visualization**: Tableau, ggplot2, Matplotlib; MDS, Volcano, Forest, Manhattan plots



### Current Interests  
**[Cancer Risk Prediction Model](https://github.com/natalierellis/CancerRiskPrediction)**  
- **Survival Analysis & Predictive Modeling:**  
  - Engineering epidemiological & genomic features for a predictive model estimating individualized cancer onset.  
  - Applying Kaplan-Meier risk stratification to assess feature prognostic relevance.  
- **Cloud-Based Genomic Analysis:**  
  - Filtering srWGS variants by locus, allele frequency (AF), and QC metrics in GCP for high-throughput data processing.

### Highlights from My Portfolio  
- **[Patient Mortality Prediction](https://github.com/natalierellis/HIDS-Portfolio/tree/main/Patient_Mortality_Prediction):**
  - Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline for predicting 180-day mortality using OMOP-formatted EHR data.  
  - Built automated workflows for data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation (Scikit-learn, Matplotlib).  
- **[Biomedical Data Analysis](https://github.com/natalierellis/HIDS-Portfolio/tree/main/Comparative_Genomics_Pipelines):**
  - Identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Alzheimerâ€™s & bladder cancer datasets.  
  - Applied enrichment analysis (KEGG, Reactome) to uncover biological pathways linked to disease progression.
