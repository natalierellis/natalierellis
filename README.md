# 👋 Hi, I'm Natalie Ellis!  

## 🎓 About Me  
Master’s student in Health Informatics & Data Science at Georgetown University, passionate about leveraging data-driven solutions for precision medicine and healthcare analytics.  
Currently seeking **Data Analyst** or **Data Scientist** roles in the DMV area starting Fall 2025.  

My research interests include **risk prediction modeling** (integrating genetic & environmental data for cancer risk assessment) and **healthcare analytics** (leveraging bioinformatics & machine learning to uncover biomarkers and improve risk stratification).


### 🛠️ Skills & Tools  
- **Genomic Data & Bioinformatics:** Hail, Variant Filtering, BLAST, CIBERSORTx
- **Programming & Databases:** Python, R, SQL (PostgreSQL), JavaScript
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, EnrichR
- **Healthcare & Interoperability:** FHIR, OpenEMR, HAPI FHIR API
- **Data Visualization & Cloud Computing:** Tableau, ggplot2, Matplotlib, Google Cloud (GCP), Hail MatrixTables


### 🌟 Current Interests  
- **Advancing Healthcare Analytics:**  
  - Leveraging bioinformatics and machine learning tools to integrate multi-omics data for precision medicine.
- **Developing Risk Prediction Models:**  
  - Training predictive models using genetic and environmental features to assess cancer risk across cohorts (no cancer, precancerous, cancer).
